# Smart Traffic Lights

AI-powered intelligent traffic management system for urban intersections.

## Overview

Smart Traffic Lights is an adaptive traffic control system that uses AI to analyze real-time traffic conditions and optimize signal timings. Unlike traditional fixed-schedule traffic lights, our system dynamically adjusts to current road conditions, reducing congestion and wait times.

## Tech Stack

- **Backend**: Java (Spring Boot), Python
- **Frontend**: JavaScript, React
- **AI/ML**: Scikit-learn (Random Forest)
- **Infrastructure**: Docker, AWS EC2

## Features

- Real-time traffic monitoring and analysis
- Adaptive traffic light timing recommendations
- Interactive simulation environment
- AI-powered chatbot for project information
- Multi-intersection coordination capability


## Next Steps

- Expand simulation to multiple intersections
- Add more traffic parameters
- Test various ML/AI approaches
- Integrate real traffic data from Yandex Maps
- MVP testing on small real-world streets
- Collaborate with traffic authorities for real-world integration
